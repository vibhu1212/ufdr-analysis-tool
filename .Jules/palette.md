## 2024-04-05 - Streamlit Button Alignment & Tooltips
**Learning:** Using invalid kwargs like `width="stretch"` in Streamlit `st.button` fails silently, leaving buttons unaligned and poorly structured. In addition, providing tooltips (`help` parameter) is crucial for primary action buttons to improve user confidence and accessibility.
**Action:** Always use `use_container_width=True` for column-filling buttons and include `help` descriptions for UI accessibility and user guidance.
## 2024-03-24 - Initial Learnings\n**Learning:** This repo is a Streamlit application primarily, with some minimal React code in `frontend/src/`. It doesn't use `package.json` or standard node package managers at the root level.\n**Action:** Focus on Streamlit UI elements in Python, or the specific React file if applicable, but note that standard `pnpm` commands might not apply if it's not a standard node project.
## 2026-04-25 - Empty State Implementation
**Learning:** Implementing empty states in Streamlit requires careful CSS injection. Injecting inline styles into a generic markdown block directly solves the blank canvas problem without writing complex custom components or modifying global themes.
**Action:** Add similar empty state blocks whenever an application tab/page awaits user input or actions before rendering data.
