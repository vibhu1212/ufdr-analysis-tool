## 2024-04-05 - Streamlit Button Alignment & Tooltips
**Learning:** Using invalid kwargs like `width="stretch"` in Streamlit `st.button` fails silently, leaving buttons unaligned and poorly structured. In addition, providing tooltips (`help` parameter) is crucial for primary action buttons to improve user confidence and accessibility.
**Action:** Always use `use_container_width=True` for column-filling buttons and include `help` descriptions for UI accessibility and user guidance.
## 2024-03-24 - Initial Learnings\n**Learning:** This repo is a Streamlit application primarily, with some minimal React code in `frontend/src/`. It doesn't use `package.json` or standard node package managers at the root level.\n**Action:** Focus on Streamlit UI elements in Python, or the specific React file if applicable, but note that standard `pnpm` commands might not apply if it's not a standard node project.

## 2024-05-18 - Chat Empty States
**Learning:** Conversational interfaces without an initial context can leave users confused about capabilities (the "blank canvas" problem). Adding an empty state with example queries significantly improves initial interaction UX and helps guide the user on what kind of questions the AI can handle.
**Action:** Always provide a welcome message with example queries for chat-based or conversational components when the history is empty.
