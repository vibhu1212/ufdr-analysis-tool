## 2024-04-05 - Streamlit Button Alignment & Tooltips
**Learning:** Using invalid kwargs like `width="stretch"` in Streamlit `st.button` fails silently, leaving buttons unaligned and poorly structured. In addition, providing tooltips (`help` parameter) is crucial for primary action buttons to improve user confidence and accessibility.
**Action:** Always use `use_container_width=True` for column-filling buttons and include `help` descriptions for UI accessibility and user guidance.
